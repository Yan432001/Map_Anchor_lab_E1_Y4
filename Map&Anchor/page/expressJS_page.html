                    Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.[3] It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.[4]<br>

                    The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server,[5] meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the back-end component of popular development stacks like the MEAN, MERN or MEVN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and a JavaScript front-end framework or library.[6]

                <p>
                    Express.js was founded by TJ Holowaychuk. The first release, according to Express.js's GitHub repository, was on 22 May 2010. Version 0.12<br>

                    In June 2014, rights to manage the project were acquired by StrongLoop.[7] StrongLoop was acquired by IBM in September 2015;[8] in January 2016, IBM announced that it would place Express.js under the stewardship of the Node.js Foundation incubator.[9]

                <h1>Steps to create an Express.js Application</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Express is the most popular minimalistic framework. It is built upon the built-in module HTTP of NodeJS to facilitate the simple and easy interaction between frontend and backend logic through API, and also it enables us to organize our business logic in so much pretty manner. It is much flexible and we can use it for both the web and android. Also, it provides a very simple error handling procedure.<br>

                    Approach: Below is the fundamental steps to write an express app. Here we are covering the topics like setting up the environment with the installation of modules, creating an application, running the web server, and performing basic communication with the server. Must-Know how to use the node package manager for basic works, basic knowledge of the terminal for installing dependencies and modules, basic knowledge of how a web application works, and a good knowledge of ES6. <br>

                    Step by step Implementation:<br>

                    Step 1: Write this command in your terminal, to create a nodejs application, because our express server will work inside the node application.<br>
                    <code>npm init</code>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    This will ask you for few configurations about your project you can fill them accordingly, also you can change it later from the package.json file. <br>
                    Note: Use `npm init -y` for default initialization<br>
