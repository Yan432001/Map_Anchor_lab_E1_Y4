                <p>
                    Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+")[4] is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.<br>

                    Differences between Angular and AngularJS<br>

                    Architecture of an Angular application. The main building blocks are modules, components, templates, metadata, data binding, directives, services, and dependency injection.
                    Google designed Angular as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.<br>

                    Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers; instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic.[5]<br>
                    Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding[6]<br>
                    Modularity – much core functionality has moved to modules<br>
                    Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following features:<br>
                    Static typing, including Generics<br>
                    Type annotations<br>
                    Dynamic loading<br>
                    Asynchronous template compilations<br>
                    Iterative callbacks provided by RxJS.<br>
                    Support to run Angular applications on servers.
                </p>

                <h1 id="his">History</h1><br>
                <b>Naming</b>
                <p>
                    The rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2", but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the Team announced that separate names should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.[7]
                </p><br>
                <b>Version 2</b>
                <p>
                    Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22–23 October 2014.[8][9] The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers.[10] On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview.[11] Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015,[12] and the first release candidate was published in May 2016.[13] The final version was released on 14 September 2016
                </p><br>
                <b>Version 4</b>
                <p>
                    On 13 December 2016 Angular 4 was announced, skipping 3 to avoid a confusion due to the misalignment of the router package's version which was already distributed as v3.3.0.[14] The final version was released on 23 March 2017.[15] Angular 4 is backward compatible with Angular 2.[16]<br>

                    Angular version 4.3 is a minor release, meaning that it contains no breaking changes and that it is a drop-in replacement for 4.x.x.<br>

                    Features in version 4.3<br>

                    Introducing HttpClient, a smaller, easier to use, and more powerful library for making HTTP Requests.<br>
                    New router life cycle events for Guards and Resolvers. Four new events: GuardsCheckStart, GuardsCheckEnd, ResolveStart, ResolveEnd join the existing set of life cycle event such as NavigationStart.<br>
                    Conditionally disable animations.
                </p><br>
                <b>Version 5</b>
                <p>
                    Angular 5 was released on 1 November 2017.[17] Key improvements in Angular 5 include support for progressive web apps, a build optimizer and improvements related to Material Design.[18]
                </p><br>
                <b>Version 7</b>
                <p>
                    Angular 7 was released on 18 October 2018. Updates regarding Application Performance, Angular Material & CDK, Virtual Scrolling, Improved Accessibility of Selects, now supports Content Projection using web standard for custom elements, and dependency updates regarding Typescript 3.1, RxJS 6.3, Node 10 (still supporting Node 8).[20]
                </p><br>
                <b>Version 8</b>
                <p>
                    Angular 8 was released on 28 May 2019. Featuring Differential loading for all application code, Dynamic imports for lazy routes, Web workers, TypeScript 3.4 support, and Angular Ivy as an opt-in preview. Angular Ivy opt-in preview includes:[21]<br>

                    Generated code that is easier to read and debug at runtime<br>
                    Faster re-build time<br>
                    Improved payload size<br>
                    Improved template type checking<br>
                    Backwards compatibility<br>
                </p><br>
                <b>Version 9</b><br>
                <b>Version 10</b><br>
                <b>Version 11</b><br>
                <b>Version 12</b><br>
                <b>Version 13</b><br>
                <b>Version 14</b><br>
                <b>Version 15</b><br>
                <b>Version 16</b><br>
                <b>Future releases</b><br>
                <b>Support policy and schedule</b>
                <p>
                    All the major releases are supported for 18 months. This consists of 6 months of active support, during which regularly-scheduled updates and patches are released. It is then followed by 12 months of long-term support (LTS), during which only critical fixes and security patches are released.[27]

                    This tutorial consists of lessons that introduce the Angular concepts you need to know to start coding in Angular.<br>
                    You can do as many or as few as you would like and you can do them in any order.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Before you start</h4><br>
                <p>

                </p><br>
                <h5>Your experience</h5><br>
                <p>
                    The lessons in this tutorial assume that you have experience with the following:<br>

                    Created an HTML web page by editing the HTML directly.<br>
                    Programmed web site content in JavaScript.<br>
                    Read Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) content and understand how selectors are used.<br>
                    Used command-line instructions to perform tasks on your computer.
                </p><br>
                <h5>Your equipment</h5><br>
                <p>
                    These lessons can be completed by using a local installation of the Angular tools or by using StackBlitz in a web browser. Local Angular development can be completed on Windows, MacOS or Linux based systems.

                <h4>Local development environment</h4><br>
                <p>
                    Perform these steps in a command-line tool on the computer you want to use for this tutorial.

                <h1>lesson 1: Hello World</h1><br>
                <p>
                    This first lesson serves as the starting point from which each lesson in this tutorial adds new features to build a complete Angular app. In this lesson, we'll update the application to display the famous text, "Hello World".<br>

                    Estimated time: ~10 minutes<br>
                </p><br>
                <h4>What you'll learn</h4><br>
                <p>
                    The updated app you have after this lesson confirms that you and your IDE are ready to begin creating an Angular app.
                </p><br>
                <h5>Step 1 - Test the default app</h5><br>
                <p>
                    In this step, after you download the default starting app, you build the default Angular app. This confirms that your development environment has what you need to continue the tutorial.
                </p><br>
                <img src="../img/angular/ang-1.png" alt=""><br>
                <h4>Step 2 - Review the files in the project</h4><br>
                <p>
                    In this step, you get to know the files that make up a default Angular app.
                </p><br>
                <img src="../img/angular/ang-2.png" alt=""><br>
                <p>
                    After you have reviewed the files that make up an Angular app project, continue to the next step.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Step 3 - Create Hello World
                </h4><br>
                <p>
                    In this step, you update the Angular project files to change the displayed content.
                </p><br>

                <h4>Lesson review</h4><br>
                <p>
                    In this lesson, you updated a default Angular app to display Hello world. In the process, you learned about the ng serve command to serve your app locally for testing.<br>

                    If you have any trouble with this lesson, review the completed code for it in the live example / download example.
